                Episode 1 The Bus/The Pitch

                The Bus
                
                (Christian's Home. Messy but not a pit.. He is cooking. Radio is playing.)
                
                Radio: 
                The James Webb spacecraft's photos of Pluto reveal strange landmarks. One in the shape of a heart, another in the shape of the demon god Cthulhu. Is this the sign of our impending doom, or an overabundance of hallucinogens in our water supply? This reporter would have to say…...yes.
                
                (Christians food catches on fire suddenly, he rushes to put it out.)
                
                (Kyle at work, convenience store, on his laptop.)
                
                Kyle: 
                Ah…...uhhh…..uh,uh,uh...OH!...mmmmmmmmmmmmhm….Oh no no no no no no no no no no. 
                
                (Christian folding laundry humming and softly singing.)
                
                
                Christian:
                 “I like to shoot children in the face with bottles, guns, and fireworks. It is my favorite thing to do. When they cry it makes me oh so hard.”
                
                (While his back is turned his clothes burst into flames and he rushes to put them out.)
                
                (Kyle trying to work out a technical problem while an older customer tries to get his attention.)
                
                Woman:
                 Sir, excuse me…….Sir excuse me!
                
                Kyle:
                Yes m’am how can I….
                
                Woman: 
                Hello.
                
                Kyle:
                 Hi.
                
                Woman: 
                How are you?
                
                Kyle:
                Fine. How can I….
                
                Woman: 
                Can you help me?
                
                Kyle: 
                Yes, I can.
                
                Woman: 
                I need pads.
                
                Kyle: 
                Pads?
                
                Woman: 
                Pads, Maxi Pads. You know, feminine napkins.
                
                Kyle:
                 Yes. We have them right over…
                
                
                Woman: 
                I need them because I am menstruating.
                
                Beat
                
                Kyle: 
                Well they are right over….
                
                Woman:
                 It’s my time of the month you see.
                
                Kyle: 
                Okay
                
                Woman: 
                Well?
                
                Kyle: 
                Well?
                
                Woman: 
                Are you going to help me or not?
                
                Kyle: 
                Yes they are just over….
                
                Woman: 
                Because if you aren’t I will take my business elsewhere. Because my vagina is bleeding.
