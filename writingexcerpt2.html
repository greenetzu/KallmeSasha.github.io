                Do not hang your head out of a moving train. It is never a good idea. You might think that it would give you a stunning view of the smoke stack coming around a bend. The cliff side dropping off beneath, the sun rising above the mountains. Lights bouncing from the ordered cars filigree. It would be marvelous to behold, a complex piece depicting human modernity and ingenuity juxtaposed against nature's own edifice.
	Were it not for the rushing winds forcing your head back. Or the insects embedding themselves in your eyes and mouth. Or the heavily muscled man's ursine paw holding your neck against the frame of the window. Indeed if I am being honest, with just one less impediment it would be almost an enjoyable experience. I know which I would choose. However I will leave any individual to choose for themselves.
	From inside the compartment where the rest of my body sat a voice was somewhat audible.
	“Ach,” I quipped back. At that I was returned to my previous upright position, head inside with the rest of the gathered party. With my neck freed and my ears no longer filled with wind my companion repeated the request.
	“I say to you again Mr. Statler, inform me what you discovered at the Grimmsby Fort. Along with the location of your companion, and you shall be excused at your destination,” the older gentleman said with the same measured tone as before he had had his veritable beefcake of a valet press my skull through the window.
	“Now,” I coughed while retaining my dignity. “Mr. Carver, I told you in the dining car, as well as in the hallway from the dining car to your private carriage. Carried so professionally and gently by your… colleague. Please refer to me by my given name, Cassius.”
	“Cassius… I must tell you that I am not normally as accommodating to individuals who stand in opposition to me. I am extending a great deal of courtesy. Please with respect to the mother who raised you with manners,” Mr. Carver said, thrumming his fingers along the head of his ivory topped cane.
	“Let us leave my mother out of this. A fair woman in all respects however neither of us are in a position to speak for or to her. To answer you again we found nothing of note at the old fort. Rusted armor, rotting wood and an old moth eaten officers uniform. If you would like that I think Townsend here would look quite fetching,” I said scratching my face. Carver's nostrils flared and his mustache twitched in its characteristic fashion. For all my uncle's business sense his tells were numerous. Probably why he usually worked through intermediaries.
“You know Cassius, I always liked you. You showed a lot of promise growing up. A hard worker, always walked with dignity, smart. Maybe too much for your own good at times but that was never a problem that could not be fixed,” Mr. Carver said, sighing.	
Calling me a good student was a tad bit of a stretch if I am being honest. I had good marks but most of my teachers would have described me as a gifted speaker but a challenged listener. I would argue that I was an excellent listener if only they chose to speak on a subject that was worth listening too.
“Is this the part where you tell me you will have to take a firmer hand with me from now on. That you will ensure through personal effort that I become a worthy successor to our family's legacy?” I asked, this was a speech I had heard before.
“No,” my uncle responded. “This is the part where I have Townsend here throw you out the window and we search your compartment. Townsend if you would be so kind.”
